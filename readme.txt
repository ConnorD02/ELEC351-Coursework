1.-Compulsory Done 10
A Ticker class timer is used to set a time of 10 seconds which enters an ISR after triggering. The ISR collects a sample and then adds the data processing functions to an event queue. The sample collection is done by a dedicated thread of the highest priority while the event queue is handled by another thread. The data is held within the structure sampleData.
